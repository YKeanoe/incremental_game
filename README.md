Incremental Game
==============================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZankiMaru/incremental_game.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/ZankiMaru/incremental_game)

I can't think of a good name yet for this game but it is an incremental / idle game. The idea is to manage a civilization starting from a house of 2 sim up to a super power nation. I might add more features but my goal is to successfully build a basic incremental app. 

The application is mostly built on HTML5 using javascript. As of right now, the app is using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), [JQuery](https://jquery.com), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

There are a few games that inspired me to make this game, but two of the most influential are [Swarm Simulator](https://swarmsim.github.io) and [Pixels Filling Squares Dx](https://www.kongregate.com/games/Moczan/pixels-filling-squares-dx).
